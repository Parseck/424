<p class="w3-justify">FourToFour started in the basement of the mother of the creator of FourToFour. Prefering Anonymity when shoping online, the creator of 424 knew that there was a market, and they jumped onto making the service. Using Escrow technology, as well as online anonymity protection protocols including support for bitcoin and etherium, no weblogging on the website itself, and client-sided account based shopping. You post the item you want to sell, or you buy the item you want to buy. 424, at the time of receiving a transaction notice, will use your 424Escrow Account (which comes with a 424 account) to store the agreed upon money. Then, 424 will send a request for the shipping of the item to 424 HQ, which will then ship the item to the Adress recorded in your 424 account. <br><br> Your Anonymity is kept secure from vendors and other customers. Reviews use a 4chan-style anonymous posting method. Signing up for an account does entail and implies agreement to the release of personal information to FourToFour.

FourToFour does not own, nor does it have any affiliation with any brands that the items sold on this platform may be from. FourToFour does not sell products itself.
